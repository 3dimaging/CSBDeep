CSBDeep â€“ a toolbox for applying CARE
=====================================

This is the documentation for the
`CSBDeep Python package <https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/CSBDeep_code>`_
that allows to train and apply CARE networks. Please see the
`CSBDeep webpage <http://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/>`_
for more information with links to our manuscript and supplementary material.

.. note::
    This is an early version of the software.
    It currently only supports CARE networks for direct image restoration/enhancement, i.e.
    surface extraction/projection and isotropic reconstruction are not available yet.
    Furthermore, the necessary training data can only be generated from aligned
    raw images (e.g. low- and high-SNR). Creating training data via simulation is
    currently not implemented.


After :doc:`installation </install>` of the Python package,
we recommend to follow the provided `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks
that provide step-by-step instructions on how to use this package.
They can be found in the subfolder ``notebooks``:

#. `datagen.ipynb`_:
   Creating training data from aligned raw images.
   More documentation available at :doc:`datagen`.

#. `training.ipynb`_:
   Defining a CARE network and training it based on the data created in the first step.
   More documentation available at :doc:`training`.
